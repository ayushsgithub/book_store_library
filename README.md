- **Express.js**: A Node.js web application framework used for building the server-side API.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface and frontend components.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## Folder Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

```

├── client/
├── server/
├── README.md
```

- `client/`: Contains all the frontend code.
  - `client/src/`: Includes all frontend components and page routes.

  - `server/routes/`: Contains all the route handlers.




## Running the application locally on your machine

To run the BookStore project on your local machine, which consists of two main folders (client and server) with a MongoDB backend and an example `.env` file in the server folder, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. MongoDB: Install and set up MongoDB on your local machine. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushsgithub/bookStore.git
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:

   Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies for both the client and server:

   ```bash
   cd bookStore/client
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. Set Up MongoDB:

   - Make sure MongoDB is running locally on your machine. You can start MongoDB by running `mongod` in your terminal.

4. Create a `.env` File:

   In the `server` directory, create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file and updating it with your MongoDB connection URI and any other environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file with your MongoDB URI and any other necessary configurations.

5. Start the Server:

   In the `server` directory, start the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server at `http://localhost:5000`.

6. Start the Client:

   In the `client` directory, start the React client:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

7. Access the Application:

   You should now be able to access the BookStore application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with the online book store and test its features locally.

That's it! You've successfully set up and run the BookStore project on your local machine. You can now browse, add, edit, and delete books in your local BookStore.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies for both the client and server by navigating to the respective directories and running `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection in the server.
4. Start the server by running `npm start` in the server directory.
5. Start the client by running `npm start` in the client directory.
6. Access the BookStore project in your web browser at the specified URL.
